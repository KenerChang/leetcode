# Introduction to the repo
This project is a code base for putting my implementation to leetcode problems.

# Why I create this repo
I need somewhere to store my code. Besides, I expect that someone who also tries in solving leetcode problems can find my solution and give me some feedback.

# Structure of the repo
Folders under the root path are represented in number of leet code problem. The folder name is like 0039 or 0040. 

Each problem folder is composed of a README.md file and folders which represent implementation of each programming language.

The README.md file in each problem folder is used to describe my though and solution to this problem.
